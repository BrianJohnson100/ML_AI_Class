**Assignment:** What factors contribute to a customer accepting the coupon?
Context My objective is to understand the factors that influence a drivers decision to accept a location-based mobile coupon while driving. I aim to explore how variables such as the type of business (e.g., restaurant, bar, coffee house), the presence of passengers (including minors), proximity to the business, weather conditions, and time of day affect coupon acceptance behavior. By analyzing these factorsL, I intend to develop a predictive model or framework that can determine the likelihood of a driver accepting a coupon once it is delivered to them.

**My goal:** in this project is to apply my understanding of visualizations and probability distributions to effectively distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon and those who did not. By analyzing patterns in the data, I aim to uncover meaningful insights that can help predict coupon acceptance behavior.*
